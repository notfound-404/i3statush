# i3statush 

## About
This script is an alternative to [i3status](https://github.com/i3/i3status) which is shipped by default with i3.
I am hoping to make it as modular & efficient as possible.

## Installing
To install i3statush:
- Simply copy the script in your `~/.i3/` folder for example, or clone this repository to update it easily.
- Modify your `~/.i3/config` file so that you have under the "bar" section: `status_command /home/<user>/.i3/status.sh`
